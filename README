REORIENT

What It Is
==============
Simple, Javascript, Zepto-based mobile orientation change detector

Why I Made It
==============
Certain Android phones were firing 'orientationchange' events in an infinite loop at me.
I needed a "git er dun" solution, so I wrote a very simple Zepto plug-in to do the trick.
Hack and abuse it to your heart's content.

How To Use
==============
1) Use Zepto for your mobile project (zeptojs.com, github.com/madrobby/zepto)
2) Include dist/reorient.min.js in your HTML after Zepto
3) Bind your handlers to the reorient event like this: $(window).bind('reorient', function() { ... });
4) Write your CSS to react to 'body.landscape' and 'body.portrait' selectors, which reorient will update before event triggering
4) In your DOM ready event, call $.reorient.start() to begin detection

Still Curious?
==============
Reorient adds the reorient object to Zepto.  Look at src/reorient.js to see what this object does.
